# How To Run:
## Through Visual Studio
1) Open "**CMP1903M Assessment 1 Base Code.sln**"
   (Visual Studio will warn you about opening files from trusted sources)
2) When Visual Studio is loaded, at the top, click **CMP1903M Assessment 1 Base Code** with the green play button

## Through Console
1) Go to: CMP1903M Assessment 1 Base Code > bin > Debug > net6.0 
   (Downloads\CMP1903M-Assessment-1-NathanMace-master\CMP1903M-Assessment-1-NathanMace-master)
2) Open **CMP1903M Assessment 1 Base Code.exe**
   (Windows pop-up will appear saying "Windows protected your PC", if this happens click <ins>More info</ins> then <ins>Run anyway</ins>

(When the Console is running, and you choose Option 2, both the file the program reads **and** Long Words.txt will appear here.)

# How To Use:
When the Console launches, the program will ask you to choose between sorting your own text (Input '1') or sorting through a text file (Input '2').

## Option 1
When you choose Option 1, the program will allow you to enter any text you want. 

**However**, please when finishing a sentence add a full stop to the end so that the program can correctly count the number of sentences your text provides. 

When you are done, on a new line, use a singular asterisk and hit the Enter key. This will start the program's calculation.

Once done, the program will give you a list of Sentences, Characters, Vowels, Consonants, Upper and Lower Cases, Numbers, Symbols, Spaces and Total Characters in your text.

After this, it will tell you to hit the Enter key to exit the program.

## Option 2
When you choose Option 2, the program will read the **CMP1903M Assessment 1 Test File.txt** file located in CMP1903M Assessment 1 Base Code > bin > Debug > net6.0

The program will give you a list of Sentences, Characters, Vowels, Consonants, Upper and Lower Cases, Numbers, Symbols, Spaces and Total Characters in the text file.

The program will also generate a .txt file in the same location named **Long Words.txt**. The text file will contain all words with 8 or more letters in the test text file, and it will tell you this in the Console.

After this, it will tell you to hit the Enter key to exit the program.
